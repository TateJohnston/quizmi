ON THE WEBSITE:

1. either create an account with your own details OR
2. log in and use email: testing@gmail.com, password: test
3. If using testing@gmail.com - Select a subject from the subject column, then select a quiz from the quiz column, should have a flashcard saying start quiz pop up.
4. if using new account, create a subject and then create a quiz using the add subject and add quiz seach fields.

WHATS NOT WORKING SO FAR:

1. The interactions between the create quiz component and quiz component are not functional. Needs further testing and editing.
2. after refreshing the browser i need to make the page stay on the current page rather than going back to the home page.
